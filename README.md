# store

I have completed the initial modeling of the project for the online store. The project is built using the Django framework and is currently in its early stages of development.

The primary focus has been on designing the database schema, creating models, and setting up the basic structure. This includes defining entities such as customers, products, orders, and their relationships. Additionally, I've integrated features like user registration and API endpoints for retrieving customer data.
